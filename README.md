# 📊 AI in Marketing – Consumer Behavior Prediction and Analysis

This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence** can be applied in marketing to understand, predict, and influence **consumer behavior**. Using machine learning techniques on marketing data, the model classifies or predicts customer decisions and helps optimize campaign strategies.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Analyze marketing data to predict customer responses to campaigns.  
- **Approach**: Supervised ML algorithms with preprocessing and feature engineering.  
- **Output**: Predictive model with performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
